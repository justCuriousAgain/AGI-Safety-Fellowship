## Exercises

* A crucial feature of AGI is that it will possess cognitive skills which are useful across a range of tasks, rather than just the tasks it was trained to perform. Which cognitive skills did humans evolve because they were useful in our ancestral environments, which have remained useful in our modern environment? Which have become less useful?

> Relevant:
    >>
    >> Language (Still relevant)
>
> Not always relevant:
    >>
    >> Making tools (Relevant but maybe not so much on an individual level)

* What are the most plausible ways for the hypothesis “we will eventually build AGIs which have transformative impacts on the world” to be false? How likely are they?

> Something like Neuralink/developments in Gene editing can be a plausible way to make it false.
