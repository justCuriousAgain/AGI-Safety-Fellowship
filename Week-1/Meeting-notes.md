# Meeting Notes

* Questions to think about:
  
  * Will scientists delegate the task of making discoveries to the AGI? Isn't it that people want to figure out stuff for themselves the real joy of science?

  * Interpretability - Wouldn't making an AGI be equivalent to creating a sort of god for humanity whose working we've been trying to figure out since the beginning of human civilization itself? and as a result of which we came up with the scientific method?
  
  * How's this for a definition of an AGI/ASI? - Given an objective, it can figure out a way to accomplish that objective? - Need to think about the P/NP space etc.
  
  * If humanity could coordinate and work on something as a single unit, something that beats that will be considered superintelligence?
